Power*DBA Installation Quickstart for Tomcat

1.  Place the file powerdba.jar in the webapps directory under tomcat and run "jar -xvf powerdba.jar" to explode it.  

2.  Place the dbconfig.xml file in the directory where you start tomcat.  See note 1 below.

3.  Edit the dbconfig.xml file, setting up your databases. Connections should be to a valid Oracle dba account.

4.  Edit the file webapps/powerdba/WEB-INF/classes/com/powerdba/util/powerdba.properties setting chartTmp & traceFileDirectory, 
    see note 2 below.

5.  On unix, in order for the charting to work (jfreechart uses awt and awt on unix normally needs the x server), 
    you need to set the env variable shown below, in your startup script prior to starting tomcat.
    This tells the jvm not look for an X server.  This is not an issue on Windows.  Put this in the tomcat startup script.
    
                   CATALINA_OPTS=-Djava.awt.headless=true; export CATALINA_OPTS
                   
Example tomcat startup shell script:

#!/bin/sh
JAVA_HOME=/apps/oracle/product/10.1.0/db/jdk; export JAVA_HOME
CATALINA_HOME=/apps/oracle/tomcat/kurt_tomcat; export CATALINA_HOME
CATALINA_OPTS=-Djava.awt.headless=true; export CATALINA_OPTS
CLASSPATH=$CATALINA_HOME/common/lib/servlet.jar:$CATALINA_HOME/common/lib/jdom.jar:$CATALINA_HOME/common/lib/xerces.jar:$CLASSPATH; export CLASSPATH
PATH=$CATALINA_HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH; export PATH
# cd to the conf directory so tomcat can read the dbconfig.xml file stored there
cd /apps/oracle/tomcat/conf
$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh 

6.  Restart tomcat.

7.  http://hostname:tomcatport/powerdba/powerdba.jsp to access powerdba.


Power*DBA Installation Notes

1.  The included file dbconfig.xml is an example of how to set up database connections.  
    Place this file in the directory where you start tomcat.  
    If you need to move it, specify its location in the powerdba.properties file property connectionPoolPropertiesFile.  
    You can also add, edit, remove connections via the admin GUI.  You can also monitor the status of the databases here.

2.  Edit the powerdba.properties file in webapps/powerdba/WEB-INF/classes/com/powerdba/util, and set the following two properties:
  - chartTmp (directory where temp files for charting are written), a recommendation here is to use /tmp or something on unix.
    these files are constantly being created and removed.
  - traceFileDirectory (directory where trace files are written), a recommendation here may be to use the tomcat/log directory
    for your tomcat installation.

3. Currently, the admin password is anything other than null.

4. In order to get meaningful charting data in Oracle 9i and earlier, install and configure Oracle's statspack in the database 
   needing to be monitoried/managed.  It is available in the $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin directory.  
   Run spcreate.sql and spauto.sql to install and put perfstat on the job queue.   
   by default the job will run on the hour.  To get more granular charting data, set the job to run at a shorter interval.  
   The following code can be used instead of spauto.sql to submit at other than 1 hour intervals.

-- Submit statspack to run every 5 minutes.
variable jobno number;
variable instno number;
begin
  select instance_number into :instno from v$instance;
  dbms_job.submit(:jobno, 'statspack.snap;', sysdate, 'SYSDATE+(5/1440)', TRUE, :instno);
  commit;
end;
/ 

5.  In a RAC system, you must configure connections in dbconfig.xml to each instance in your clustered database.
