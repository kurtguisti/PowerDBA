New Screen

1.  Add action to mvc/PowerDbaActions
2.  Add action to conf/actions.xml file.
3.  Add query to conf/sql-10.xml or sql-common.xml or sql-11.xml
3.  Modify the class MenuGenerator to add the menu item.

New Lookup on an existing screen.

1.  Add query to lookup-queries.xml.  The first field in the select list is the variable that the value will
return into and must be named the same as the lookup name attribute in the lookup in lookups.xml.
2.  Add entry to lookups.xml which is where we setup a group of lookups to a name.
3.  Edit powerdbaManager.java in setLookup groups to attache the lookup group to the action.
4.  In the query itself in the sql*.xml files use a question mark with a like clause for that column.  Also,
define a bind variable in the query's xml that binds the variable name in the lookup definition into the
position marker.

Relationship between screens sql and also how variables are gotten and then bound into to the next query.

The other way to get a bind variable into a query is by defining a link in the sql xml.  The variable name 
you associate with that link is automatically passed to the next page as a request variable and can then
be read by the next pages sql bind definitions.
